  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm,<br> 
    and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.<br> 
    It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it,<br> 
    and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.<br> 
    Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification,<br> 
    with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
